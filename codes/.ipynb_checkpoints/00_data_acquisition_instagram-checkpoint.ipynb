    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "With the rise in the demand for international travel, especially due to the pent-up demand from the ease of Covid travel restrictions, Singapore travellers are spoilt for choice and to decide on which places of interest to visit during the limited vacation time is no easy feat. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, most [tour packages](https://www.chanbrothers.com/package-tours) and [travel websites](https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Attractions-g186338-Activities-oa0-London_England.html) promote the typical sights and attractions instead of places where locals rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, we propose a travel recommender system to discover the hidden gems, in particular, in London."

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the [top travel trends among Singapore travellers in 2023](https://www.humanresourcesonline.net/top-travel-trends-among-singapore-travellers-in-2023), London, United Kingdom is ranked one of the top 10 popular travel destinations. As such, our project will primarily focus on the hidden gems of London.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on a [preliminary study on Social Media Data Analytics for Tourism](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1748/paper-12.pdf), it supports using social media as a useful data source for touristic decision making since it can provide real-time insights of tourists' visiting patterns. Hence, we will be using an Instagram dataset to build our recommender system.\n",
    "\n",
    "To discover the hidden gems of London, we will refer to a popular travel website, Trip Advisor, to find out the Top 50 tourist spots which will then be excluded from our Instagram dataset. According to [London Tourism Statistics](https://gowithguide.com/blog/london-tourism-statistics-2023-all-you-need-to-know-5213), the average length of stay in London for tourists is about 4.6 days. Assuming a tourist covers 5 spots for 5 days, 25 spots will be covered. As such, with the top 50 tourist spots excluded from our recommender system (an amount double of the 25 spots), it should be safe to say that our system will uncover the hidden gems for our users."
